---
You are a cursor, your human is using the computer, and tries to access the dark web through a dodgy link. You, the cursor, gets teleported through the link down into a fantasy, top-down town. You now have to make your way through the dark web, teleporting back through the correct hyperlinks to return back to your computer. You can find and collect #bitcoin as currency.
Characters in the game are reference to real life malwares.
## Interactable Characters: 
- #Loveletter > if you get kidnapped by them you have to give them #bitcoin to free yourself 

- #Morris-worm > a little worm you find in the grass, you keep encountering him and his cousins as they self-replicates, each wear different hats. 

- #Pegasus > a wooden horse that looks weird, and offers to help you get back, and takes you the wrong way - lots of stores offering drugs or illegal services 

- #Stalkerware > it hides behind bushes, if it has line of site with you then it first steals your bitcoin little by little and then it starts to drain your health 

- #Poppy > if you interact with it, then you get annoying popups that block your vision 

- #Botnet > Placeholder character
# Story building

The user in our game, John, was looking through a computer security website, and accidentally clicked on a website link to the dark web. This is shown as 4 panel comic at the beginning. As the cursor goes through the game, viruses and malware it encounters are entered in a book. The hyperlinks act as a teleporter which our game revolves around.
