## Premise
You are given a list of possible passwords extracted by the keylogger. You must brute force to find out which one is password under a time limit.

You are also given a little user profile in the top right
like "John, Middle Aged, Likes Football"

and so then when you're typing in all the passwords one after the one
there's an oppourtunity to focus on ones about football for example


## Mechanics

- Typing under a time limit
- passwords from the list disappear as you type them and get moved up so new passwords appear at the bottom
- sometimes the actual password is not on the screen yet

Old:

 Premise
Out-type the keylogger to lock down all your accounts before it sends off your passwords to the hacker.

 Mechanics
- typing race game
- a sentence will come up for you to type and you have to type faster than the keylogger
